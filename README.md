# Introduction
I aware that i need a dotfile to set up my GNU more fast and easier after i use it for a while. Every time when i want to escape from Windows, but facing such a empty ~/.config directory make my frustrated. I don't want to copy something from this machine to another, this is broing. So i decide to set up this repostory with stow. I hope it will be a good start.
