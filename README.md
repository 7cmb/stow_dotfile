# Introduction
I aware that i need a dotfile to set up my GNU quickly and easier after i use it for a while. Every time when i want to escape from Windows, but facing such a empty ~/.config directory made me frustrated. I don't want to copy something from this machine to another, this is boring. So i set up this repository with stow. I hope it will be a good start.
